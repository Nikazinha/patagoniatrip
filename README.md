<h1>PATAGONIA TRIP COUNTDOWN</h1>

You can check it out on: https://patagoniatrip.vercel.app/ 

<h3> What did I work with? </h3> 
- Used JS + HTML + CSS

<strong> With JS </strong> -> Did the Countdown Logic (Days / hours / min / sec) to my trip date from now.

<strong> With CSS </strong> - > Did the page style (used NO framwework) - Tried to work more with Flexbox to gain this skill. Also used Media Query to set more mobile responsiveness.

<strong> With HTML </strong> -> Mostly marked the Divs for the countadown container.
